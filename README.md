# NuVotifier

NuVotifier is a secure alternative to using the original Votifier project.
NuVotifier will work in place of Votifier - any vote listener that supports
Votifier will also support NuVotifier.

NuVotifier supports many different platforms using the same universal JAR:

+ Bukkit / Spigot / Paper >=1.7.10
+ Sponge 7
+ BungeeCord / Waterfall
+ Velocity

NuVotifier also adds forwarding and listener test commands not present in the
original version.
